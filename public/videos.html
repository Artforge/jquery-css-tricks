	<p>Today, we want you to watch a few very short videos. But let’s imagine that you’re watching them on TV, as if they came on during a regular commercial break. Below are four separate links to four separate videos. Under each link there are questions we’d like you to answer specific to each video.  Each one asks you for your initial reaction, so immediately after watching each video be ready to tell us exactly what you are thinking and feeling!</p>

	<p>What was your first reaction to this video? Was there anything about it that was particularly exciting or interesting? Anything about it boring or turn you off? Imagine if you were sitting at home and you saw this while you were watching TV how likely would you be to tune into the program being featured? Explain a bit more why or why not you’d be interested in watching this? What was it about the “style” of the video that stood out to you? Is this how you would have done it if you had put the video together? Why or why not?</p>

	<p>What was your first reaction to this video? Was there anything about it that was particularly exciting or interesting? Anything about it boring or turn you off? Imagine if you were sitting at home and you saw this while you were watching TV how likely would you be to tune into the program being featured? Explain a bit more why or why not you’d be interested in watching this? Did this video make you want to tune into Chiller for it’s late night programming? Why or why not?</p>

	<p>What is your first reaction to this video? Was there anything about it that was particularly exciting or interesting? Anything about it boring or turn you off?</p>
	<p>What do you think about the idea that the Chiller channel provides you different movies every Friday night that “scare you to death in a brand new way”? Is that a good thing? Is that interesting? Does it remind you of someone or something else that says something similar?</p>

	<p>The video tells you that Chiller will have, “demonic possession, alien encounters and ritual dismemberment” in their programming. What does saying this do for a horror fan like you? Interesting? Exciting? Familiar? Not interested? Why?</p>

	<p>Which, if any, of these kinds of horror make you more inclined to watch over something else you regularly watch? What show or program would you give up to tune in on Friday nights? Which clips and why did they make you want to tune in? Did any of the clips of movies shown deter you from wanting to watch Chiller’s movies on Friday nights? If yes, which clips and why did they make you decide you wouldn’t want to watch?</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSUUCzCFjWQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSUUCzCFjWQ</a></p>

	<p>What is your first reaction to this video? Was there anything about it that was particularly exciting or interesting? Anything about it boring or turn you off? Why? Did you notice the repetitive images and sounds in this video? What did you think about this aspect?</p>

	<p>What about the idea of “An 8-hour marathon of shows you can’t escape”? Did this video make you want to tune into Chiller? Tell us specifically what you saw, heard or felt that made you want to tune in. If not, tell us what you saw, heard or felt that made you decide you wouldn’t be interested in watching.</p>
